```
\> enter north into cs valley
You head north, unexpectedly entering a dark alley. Suddenly, you find yourself immersed
in woefully escaped delimiters, culture-unique encodings and flawed-type converters. 

A goggely voice gloomingly whispers: "seeeequl". You sweat and shiver as you ...

\> use data.io
Okay. You win.

### C#. Clean. Correct. Docs. Fast. Flexible. Modular. Tested. Unity.
In alphabetical order.

### SQL. GSheets. SODB. CSV. JSON. SQLiter.
Need more? Let me know => fremdspielen (at) gmail.com

### Served on the side:
I just cannot _NOT_ write code the right way ...
<p/>
- **ScriptBuilder**
  - C# script generator, only need to fill in names and method bodies
- **Automation**
  - Classes/sheets to DB schema *AND* DB schema or Sheets to classes.
- **SQLBuilder**
  - type-safe, quote-escaped SQL query builder
- **In-Memory SODB** (ScriptableObject Database)
  - access by type, query with LINQ, serializable to JSON
- **No-Reflection SQLiter**
  - `IList<IList<object>> rows = SQLiterCommand.Query("SELECT * FROM MyTable");`
- Fast Type/Value conversion of strings
  - culture-specific number formats, text encodings, avoids unnecessary TryParse
- Build your own toolchain easily!
  - Modular code, Inspector-ready settings
- Full source code included, fully documented, interface-driven
  - Nothing purposefully hidden, with JetBrains Code annotations
- Latest libs included for convenience
  - SQLite, Google Sheets, ..

### Serves any scenario: 
- (turn Code into Data) <=> (turn Data into Code)
- (Let me handle it) <=> (Wow, it just works)
- (SQLover) <=> (No SQL!)
- (Reflection is evil) <=> (I don't mind)
- (Coder) <=> (Designer)

### When? Where??

data.io is coming Q3/Q4 2022 to the Unity Asset Store!

- Interested? Contact me! => fremdspielen (at) gmail.com
- I'm looking for: early adopters / beta testers, real-world datasets for testing, understanding your workflow and pain points, ideas for more data-centric tools, love and admiration.
