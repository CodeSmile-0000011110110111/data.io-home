You head north, unexpectedly entering a dark alley due to syntax error near '('. Suddenly,
you find yourself exceptionally immersed in woefully escaped delimiters, culture-unique 
encodings and flawed-type converters.

You sweat and shiver as you ...

### Automated. Bidirectional. C#. Clean. Correct. CSV. Documented. Excel. GSheets. JSON. Fast. Flexible. Modular. SODB. SQL. SQLite. Supported. Tested. Unity.
- Looking for something specific? Let me know => fremdspielen (at) gmail.com

### Served on the side:
I just cannot _NOT_ write code the right way ...
<p/>
- **ScriptBuilder**
  - C# script generator, only need to fill in names and method bodies
- **Automation**
  - Classes/sheets to DB schema *AND* DB schema or Sheets to classes.
- **SQLBuilder**
  - type-safe, quote-escaped SQL query builder
- **In-Memory SODB** (ScriptableObject Database)
  - access by type, query with LINQ, serializable to JSON
- **No-Reflection SQLiter**
  - `IList<IList<object>> rows = SQLiterCommand.Query("SELECT * FROM MyTable");`
- Fast Type/Value conversion of strings
  - culture-specific number formats, text encodings, avoids unnecessary TryParse
- Build your own toolchain easily!
  - Modular code, Inspector-ready settings
- Full source code included, fully documented, interface-driven
  - Nothing purposefully hidden, with JetBrains Code annotations
- Latest libs included for convenience
  - SQLite, Google Sheets, ..

### Serves any scenario: 
- (turn Code into Data) <=> (turn Data into Code)
- (Let me handle it) <=> (Wow, it just works)
- (SQLover) <=> (No SQL!)
- (Reflection is evil!) <=> (Wut?)
- (Coder) <=> (Designer)

### When? Where??

data&lt;io&gt; is coming Q3/Q4 2022 to the Unity Asset Store!

- Interested? Contact me! => fremdspielen (at) gmail.com
- I'm looking for: early adopters / beta testers, real-world datasets for testing, understanding your workflow and pain points, ideas for more data-centric tools, love and admiration.
