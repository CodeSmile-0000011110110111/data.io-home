# Use data&lt;io&gt; !

### C#. Clean. Correct. Fast. Flexible. Modular. Tested. Unity.
### SQL. GSheets. SODB. CSV. JSON. SQLite(r). More ...

<p/>
#### Served on the side:
I just cannot _NOT_ write code the right way ...
<p/>
- **ScriptBuilder**
  - C# script generator, only need to fill in names and method bodies
- **Automation**
  - Classes to DB schema *AND* DB schema or CSV to classes.
- **SQLBuilder**
  - type-safe, quote-escaped SQL query builder
- **In-Memory SODB** (ScriptableObject Database)
  - access by type, query with LINQ, serializable to JSON
- **No-Reflection SQLite**
  - `IList<IList<object>> rows = SQLite*r*Command.Query("SELECT * FROM MyTable");`
- Fast Type/Value conversion from strings
  - culture-specific number formats, text encodings, avoids unnecessary TryParse
- Build your own toolchain easily!
  - Modular code, Inspector-ready settings
- Full source code included!
  - Nothing purposefully hidden! With JetBrains Code annotations
- Documented use of external code/libs and their licenses
  - Latest libs included for convenience: SQLite, Google Sheets

#### Supports any workflow: 
- (turn Code into Data) <=> (turn Data into Code)
- (Let me handle it) <=> (Wow, it just works)
- (SQL Lover) <=> (No SQL, please!)
  ...  ...  ...

### When? Where??

data.io is coming Q3/Q4 2022 to the Unity Asset Store!

- Interested? Contact me! => fremdspielen (at) gmail.com
- I'm looking for: early adopters / beta testers, real-world datasets for testing, understanding your workflow and pain points, ideas for more data-centric tools, love and admiration.
