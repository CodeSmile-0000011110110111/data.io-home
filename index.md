# Use data&lt;io&gt; !

## C#. Clean. Correct. Fast. Flexible. Modular. Tested. Unity.

## SQL. GSheets. SODB. CSV. JSON. SQLite(r). More in progress ...

<p/>

### Served on the side (I just can't *NOT* code things the right way):
* ScriptBuilder => fully customizable C# script generator with type descriptions so you only need to fill in names and method bodies
* Auto-Generate => Classes to DB schema *AND* DB schema or CSV to classes.
* SQLBuilder => type-safe, quote-escaped SQL query builder (which will eventually understand various dialects, too)
* Memory-Cached ScriptableObject Database (SODB) => serializable to JSON if needed
* No-Reflection SQLite => ´IList<IList<object>> rowsWithValues = SQLite*r*Command.Query("Select * FROM MyTable");´
* Fast Type/Value conversion from strings, with support for culture-specific number formats and any text encoding.
* Custom Editor tools fully supported with Inspector-ready settings. Build your own toolchain easily.
* Full source code included. Nothing is purposefully hidden! With JetBrains Code annotations.
* Documented use of external code/libs and their licenses.
* Latest libs included for convenience. Currently that's SQLite, Google Sheets API.

<p/>
### Supports any workflow: 
* (turn Code into Data) <=> (turn Data into Code)
* (Let me handle it) <=> (Wow, it just works)
* (SQL Lover) <=> (No SQL, please!)

### When? Where??

data.io is coming Q3/Q4 2022 to the Unity Asset Store!

- Interested? Contact me! => fremdspielen (at) gmail.com
- I'm looking for: early adopters / beta testers, real-world datasets for testing, understanding your workflow and pain points, ideas for more data-centric tools.
